I created test datasets from the python script given to me by Xiangyu. 

I adjusted what was necessary in each file to allow for the reading in of data. Changes made by me from sample files are marked with either /* */ notation to suppress output, or four slashes to delineate between my comments and those that were already included.


DLib:
The test file is called kkmeans located in the example folder. This is run by g++ kkmeans_ex.cpp -I (directory to dlib). It reads in the file called data_k4_p100000_d4_c1.txt located in the same directory. There are also example files called EIGEN_EXAMPLE.cc and EIGEN_INSTREAM.cc that demonstrate dlib's functionality with Eigen.


KMlocal: (UMD library)
The edited file is located in src, called kmlsample. This is run with several flags. 
make sample (in the bin directory)
./kmlsample -d 4 -k 4 -max 10000 -df [location of file, must be a space separated dataset] 
If you just run ./kmlsample this should give you more information about the flags. 


Waffles: (Brigham Young library)
After compilation the executable waffles_cluster located in the bin can be run using 
./waffles_cluster kmeans ~/Desktop/Github/NICE/data_k4_p100000_d4_c1.dat 4
There is also an Eigen example located in teh demos directory.

Shark:
After compiling with cmake, there will be a bin folder in the build directory with a KMeans tutorial executable. This is run with ./KmeansTutorial [input file]. This program automatically recognizes the dimensionality of the dataset. You must set the number of clusters desired, and alter the output setting based on the number of clusters. I believe this library uses vectors for storage but I am not sure.
