// This file tests the CpuOperations::Transpose() function by checking to
// See if a matrix passed is transposed in the test IsTransposed
// A transposed Nice matrix is compared to a transposed Eigen Matrix in
// Transpose Eigen
// Behavior with oddly shaped matrices is also tested with test DifferentShapes
// And TransposeZeroRows
// All tests are made using a templated test fixture which attempts
// Integer, float, and double data types
